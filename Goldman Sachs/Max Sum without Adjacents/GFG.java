/*
Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array. So 3 2 7 10 should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10) or 3 2 5 10 7 should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N,N is the size of array.
The second line of each test case contains N input C[i].

Output:

Print the maximum sum of a subsequence.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 80
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 500

Example:

Input:
2
6
5 5 10 100 10 5
4
3 2 7 10

Output:
110
13
